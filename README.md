The "OpenBattery" GitHub repository is a project that aims to provide a battery monitoring and information retrieval utility for Linux systems. It is a command-line tool written in C, designed to retrieve and display various battery-related information from the Linux kernel's sysfs interface.

The repository contains the source code for the OpenBattery utility, along with a Makefile for easy compilation and installation. The code is structured into several modules, each responsible for retrieving specific battery information such as capacity, status, energy levels, technology, voltage, and more. It utilizes file I/O operations to read the necessary information from the corresponding sysfs files.

The OpenBattery utility offers a user-friendly command-line interface, allowing users to query specific battery information by executing various commands. It provides valuable insights into the current battery state, capacity, energy levels, and technology, enabling users to monitor and manage their battery usage efficiently.

The project is open-source, allowing developers to contribute to its improvement and customization. It aims to provide a reliable and straightforward battery monitoring solution for Linux users, enhancing their overall experience and helping them make informed decisions about their battery usage.

Overall, the "OpenBattery" GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource for Linux users who seek a lightweight, command-line battery monitoring tool, providing essential information about their device's battery health and performance.
