I started writing OpenBattery source code at the beginning of june 2023.

At first i was looking for a terminal-based battery monitor for my Arch Linux system, not finding one, I decided to make mine, entirely wrote in C and with the less dependencies possible.

At the beginning the program only displayed remaining battery percentage, but at the time i write this, he now can detect amount of batterie present on the system and propose a total of 16 commands all can be combined to access to the required amount of informations.
